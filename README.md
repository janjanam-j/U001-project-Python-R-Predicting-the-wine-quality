#### >Case-01. Wine Quality Data Set
  
__Data:__ Wine Quality Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality/)
2 datasets are included, related to red and white "vinho verde wine" samples, from the north of Portugal. Each wine sample comes with a quality rating from 1 to 10, and results from several physical chemical test. There are 11 columns describing chemical properties as follows. If we were the owner of a vineyard, how might we use it? 

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): 
  - 1 - fixed acidity 
  - 2 - volatile acidity 
  - 3 - citric acid 
  - 4 - residual sugar 
  - 5 - chlorides 
  - 6 - free sulfur dioxide 
  - 7 - total sulfur dioxide 
  - 8 - density 
  - 9 - pH 
  - 10 - sulphates 
  - 11 - alcohol 

Output variable (based on sensory data): 
  - 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

__Investigation:__ What chemical charateristics are most important in predicting the quality of wine?
